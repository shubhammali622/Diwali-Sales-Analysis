# Diwali-Sales-Analysis

Introduction:

This project analyzes sales data during the Diwali festival, focusing on understanding customer behavior, sales trends, and product popularity. Diwali is one of the most significant shopping periods in India, making it a crucial time for businesses to analyze and optimize their sales strategies.

Data Source:

The dataset used in this analysis includes customer demographics, purchase amounts, product categories, and more. The data was collected during the Diwali festival, reflecting a wide range of customer interactions and sales performance.

Data Cleaning:

The dataset underwent several cleaning steps to ensure accuracy in the analysis:

- Dropped Unrelated/Blank Columns: Removed columns that were not relevant to the analysis.
- Handled Missing Values: Dropped rows with null values to avoid skewed results.
- Data Type Conversion: Converted the Amount column to integer type for accurate calculations.

These steps were necessary to prepare the data for meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The analysis focused on several key areas:

- Gender Analysis: Examined the distribution of sales based on gender, identifying which gender contributed more to total sales.
- Age Group Analysis: Analyzed sales across different age groups, determining which age groups were the most active during the Diwali season.
- State-wise Sales Performance: Identified the top 10 states in terms of total orders and sales amount, revealing regional sales patterns.
- Marital Status & Occupation Analysis: Explored how marital status and occupation influenced purchasing behavior.
- Product Category Analysis: Determined the most popular product categories and top-selling products during Diwali.

Visualizations:
The following visualizations were created to support the analysis:

- Gender vs. Total Sales: Bar plots showing the distribution of total sales by gender.
- Age Group vs. Sales: Visuals highlighting which age groups contributed the most to sales.
- State-wise Orders and Sales: Bar plots showing the top 10 states by orders and sales amount.
